# calculator-using-css-html-and-script
Description:Made a Fully  working online calculator Designed user interface with the help of Forms in HTML And CSS Styling to make it look better.
For the Logic part took the help of basic inline and external Java Script. 
for html design used form and buttons to take input and then apply Script to assign buttons the user entered value.
Here I used eval method in script to evaluate the final answer.We can perform add subtract multiply divide mod functions.
Also clear All button which will call method in script to reset the calculator to null.
